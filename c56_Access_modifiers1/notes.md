# Access Modifiers in Java

Access modifiers in Java define the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. They control the visibility of these elements to other classes and packages. Java provides four types of access modifiers:

- `public`
- `protected`
- `default` (also known as package-private)
- `private`

| Access Modifier | Within Class | Within Package | Outside Package by Subclass Only | Outside Package |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| public          | Y            | Y              | Y                                | Y               |
| protected       | Y            | Y              | Y                                | N               |
| default         | Y            | Y              | N                                | N               |
| private         | Y            | N              | N                                | N               |

**public:**
- Accessible from anywhere. There are no restrictions on accessing public members.
- Within the class: Yes

- Outside the package by subclass only: Yes
- Outside the package: Yes

**protected:**
- Accessible within the same package or by subclasses even if they are in different packages.
- Within the class: Yes
- Within the package: Yes
- Outside the package by subclass only: Yes
- Outside the package: No

**default (package-private):**
- Accessible only within the same package.
- Within the class: Yes
- Within the package: Yes
- Outside the package by subclass only: No
- Outside the package: No

**private:**
