# Hello World Program in Java

## Package
Packages in Java are used to group related classes. The `package` keyword is used to create packages. In this example, the package is named `com.company`.

## Class
In Java, every program must contain a class. The filename and the name of the class should be the same. Here, we have a class named `Main`, which serves as the entry point to the application.

## Main Method
The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is the main entry point for a Java program. Every Java program must contain this method.

## Output
The code `System.out.println("Hello World");` is used to display the output on the screen. Anything passed inside the double quotes is printed on the screen as plain text.

## Naming Conventions
- For classes, Pascal Case is used. The first and subsequent characters of a word are capital letters (uppercase). Example: `Main`, `MyScanner`, `MyEmployee`.
- For functions and variables, Camel Case Convention is used. The first character is lowercase, and subsequent characters are uppercase. Example: `myScanner`, `myMarks`.

Feel free to replace the examples with your specific code and details.
